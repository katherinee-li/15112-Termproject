A twist on the classic monopoly game. On an isometric board, players take turns rolling the dice and moving to different tiles. Tile spaces can be bought and items can be bought from stores in order to sabotage other players. The goal is to earn the most money possible, beating the game AI player and other users. 

To run project, run the file called finalProject.py.
